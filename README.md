This is a hack of Runouw's Flash game Super Mario 63. In this hack, I am using a program from [TheCoderCat](https://sites.google.com/view/thecodercatprojects) known as [Bad Translator](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/bad_translator/306615442162). This acts as an addon to Google Docs. The way the program works is you can automatically throw text you highlight through Google Translate a number of times that you specify, then it spits it back to you in English. The reasoning behind the translation being screwed up is because some languages don't have certain words, so it has to fall back to a word that's similar. Furthermore, as different languages have different structures (like how Japanese, Korean, Arabic and English use completely different lettering systems and structures), it's difficult for Google to understand it, which is why it basically breaks. Keep in mind, Google Translate is also ran by the community, so it is entirely possible for someone to maliciously edit the database to make it so random sentences translate into something that they shouldn't. The languages each line of text gets translated to is random, regardless of it being directly compatible or not. For example, if I choose 10 languages, it could start with English, then Spanish, German, Japanese, Yiddish, Welsh, Arabic, Punjabi, Chinese, Catalan, French and then finally back into English. 

Now with the boring explanation out of the way, here is what you all have been waiting for:


What exactly is Super Mario 63 Badly Translated?

This is a hack that I (Pokemonhacker1337) have made on my own for fun. It is designed to be similar to other hacked versions of games that are known for having bad translations, regardless of being on purpose or not. For example, Fatguy703's hack of Paper Mario 64 known as [Book Of Mario 64](https://book-of-mario.fandom.com/wiki/Book_of_Mario_64), his hack of Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door known as [Book of Mario: Thousands of Doors](https://book-of-mario.fandom.com/wiki/Book_of_Mario:_Thousands_of_Doors), and whatever team made [Pok√©mon Vietnamese Crystal](https://bootleggames.fandom.com/wiki/Pocket_Monsters_Crystal_Version)[.](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/34/22/35/342235838e437f8916c1de7ef6eaae7d--youtubers-video-games.jpg) In this game, I intend to give it the same treatment as much as I can, translating all of the text randomly to distort the meaning and give some good laughs.


What do I need to play this?

Download the latest version of the game (as a .swf) from the [releases section](https://github.com/PokemonHacker1337/SM63-badly-translated/releases) and play it on [Adobe's Flash Player Projector](https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html). This is compatible with Windows, Mac, and 64 bit versions of Linux. Obviously, an Internet connection will be needed to download both of these, but it works completely offline otherwise. 


Now, on to some FAQs:

Q: What's the point of this?

A: I don't know, just for fun and some laughs. 


Q: Do you moderate what goes into the hack?

A: Yes I do. In the process of translation, I have inadvertently ran into translations that could be very offensive, including bigotry and transphobia (likely from the aforementioned problem of people maliciously screwing with Google Translate). In the event that that happens, I simply undo the changes and try again. However, adult language, innuendos and dark humor will be allowed to remain, but nothing that could be potentially offensive. I cannot recommend playing this if you are under 18. 

Q: Why is this taking so long?

A: I juggle both college and a job as it is. Also, there is a lot more text in this game than you'd think. While it's not hard, it's simply time consuming. I also have to test it to make sure it at least does work.

Q: I want to try out some of the later levels, as I don't feel like playing through the entire game. How can I do that?

A: You can type the word cheat at the main menu to invoke a secret menu that allows you to enable the ability to unlock everything, and/or be able to toggle whether you have certain shine sprites or star coins. As I get to hacking later things, I intend to also maintain a debug version that allows for certain features, similar to my infinite fludd hack, this way, it is still accessible for those who are less skilled, but still want to try the game. 


Q: What all do you plan on translating?

A: Everything that is text based in the code will be translated. This includes (but is not limited to): most signs, level names, NPC dialogue, level descriptions, tutorial hints and more. 


Q: What will not be translated?

A: Anything that isn't editable text, like most interface stuff. Those are stored as pictures, which means that I'd have to export them, redraw them and import the text, which is too much work for me. Also I can't draw anyway, and getting someone to do it would be more trouble than it's worth. Another thing that won't be changed are signs with graphics, like ones in the tutorial. As a minor note, names tend to be very hard to translate to something different. A very notable example of this is a Toad that says "Obama! Obama!". Since Obama is considered to be a proper noun, translating a name to a different language would simply continue to give back the same name, since being known as John Smith in English would be the same in other languages that use the same characters, like Spanish, French and German. 


Q: I want to do a real translation to a different language, one that isn't a joke. Could you please teach me how to do what you did? 

A: Sure, but it will be very time consuming. Download and install the latest version of [ffDec](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler/releases/tag/version14.4.0) and explore the text. In theory (haven't tested this), you can use this to add text in any language, as long as you know said language. Explaining the exact way to use this will be out of the scope of this FAQ. You also will need a regular copy of Super Mario 63 in the form of a .swf, which you can get by [clicking this text](https://github.com/PokemonHacker1337/Other-Flash-Stuff/raw/main/sm63game.swf). 


Q: Will you do this with other games? 

A: Possibly, depending on how this one goes. I don't know which one I will do next though, as I don't play that many text heavy flash games. 


Q: What's the release status? 

A: Still working on it. It takes a while to find the text of the game and translate all of it. 


Q: ETA?

A: Before the year 9999. 


Q: Any TWs/Trigger Warnings?

A: So far, we have mentions of hell and suicide. You don't need to see them to beat the game, however (at least as of this writing). Edit: references to alcohol have been added.
