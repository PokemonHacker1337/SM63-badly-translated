This is a hack of Runouw's Flash game Super Mario 63. In this hack, I am using a program from [TheCoderCat](https://sites.google.com/view/thecodercatprojects) known as [Bad Translator](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/bad_translator/306615442162). This acts as an addon to Google Docs. The way the program works is it throws text you highlight through Google Translate a number of times that you specify, then it spits it back to you in English. The reasoning behind the translation being screwed up is because some languages don't have certain words, so it has to fall back to a word that's similar. Furthermore, as different languages have different structures (like how Japanese, Korean, Arabic and English use completely different lettering systems and structures), it's difficult for Google to understand it, which is why it basically breaks. Keep in mind, Google Translate is also ran by the community, so it is entirely possible for someone to maliciously edit the database to make it so random sentences translate into something that they shouldn't. 

Now with the boring explanation out of the way, here is what you all have been waiting for:


What exactly is Super Mario 63 Badly Translated?

This is a hack that I (Pokemonhacker1337) have made on my own for fun. It is designed to be similar to other hacked versions of games that are known for having bad translations, regardless of being on purpose or not. For example, Fatguy703's hack of Paper Mario 64 known as [Book Of Mario](https://book-of-mario.fandom.com/wiki/Book_of_Mario_64), [Book of Mario Thousands of Doors](https://book-of-mario.fandom.com/wiki/Book_of_Mario:_Thousands_of_Doors), [Pok√©mon Vietnamese Crystal](https://bootleggames.fandom.com/wiki/Pocket_Monsters_Crystal_Version).
